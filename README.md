## About

**ForageBuddy** is a free tool for counting and recording the number of chests gathered on a [CI forage](https://yppedia.puzzlepirates.com/Cursed_Isles) in [Puzzle Pirates](https://www.puzzlepirates.com/). It processes images of duty report screenshots taken directly after a CI forage to output an ordered summary of individual player performance.


## Usage

1. Set up your screenshot directory (the directory YPP saves screenshot to).
2. Take screenshots of the entire forage DR using `CTRL+P` (You can have duplicate people here - try to make sure you get each persons name with the chests entirely visible at the same time).
3. Click Calculate Scores.
4. If the output looks reasonable in the output box, click CopyToClipboard and, you can paste it in chat.
